## Predicting Employee Attrition in the Dawn of Recession(Kaggle Competition)
Summer Analytics 2020 Capstone Project
This was an Inclass Competition held by the Consulting and Analytics group , IIT Guwahati as the final assignment of their 6 week long Summer Analytics course. This was my first Kaggle Competition.

## Overview of Problem
As the COVID-19 keeps unleashing its havoc, the world continues to get pushed into the crisis of the great economic recession, more and more companies start to cut down their underperforming employees. Companies firing hundreds and thousands of Employees is a typical headline today. Cutting down employees or reducing an employee salary is a tough decision to take. It needs to be taken with utmost care as imprecision in the identification of employees whose performance is attriting may lead to sabotaging of both employees' career and the company's reputation in the market.
